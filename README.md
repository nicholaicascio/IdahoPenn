# Then and Now

An iPad app that is used as a supplement to the site tours or standalone as an enhancement to the experience for visitors. Users find photos and information about each important location in the facility and use augmented reality to see demolished buildings in a 3D view as they used to exist. Alternatively, models can be seen in a scaled down diorama for users that are not physically at the museum.
